# simdrone_gazebo
Work in Progress
Im a beginner to GAZIBO and quadcopter simulation.

Nature mother develops gradually.
Birds, Bees, Dragonfly and other fying souls do not know mathematical formulas calculas. They learn things gradually. They fall-->try-->fall->>try-->fall-->flyy.

The project is to about flying/comtrolling the quadcopter by getting IMU sensor data and perform Machine learning to get the new orientation/force/torque.

The project does not require ROS installation.
